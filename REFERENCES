Based on the nature of react having re-usable components throughout the application, I have dedicated this file to reference the packages particularly
used throughout the development of this application.

Packages used can be seen in both my package.json files (One within Frontend folder, and one within parent folder).

 ***** TUTORIAL/COURSE THAT HELPED WITH THIS OVERALL PROCESS *****
 Brad Traversy, 2019, MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js, https://www.udemy.com/share/101WIoAEYbcV9RRnUD/
 Used this course for connect and learn redux, which helped me with the authentication flow and allowed for alert messages if login was incorrect.
 Provided me with a boiler plate structure to use in order to develop my cooking application.
